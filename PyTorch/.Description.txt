PyTorch is an open-source deep learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It provides a flexible and intuitive platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. PyTorch is known for its dynamic computation graph, which allows for more efficient memory usage and easier debugging compared to static graphs. It has extensive support for neural network layers, optimization algorithms, and GPU acceleration, making it a popular choice for research and production in computer vision, natural language processing, and other AI applications.
