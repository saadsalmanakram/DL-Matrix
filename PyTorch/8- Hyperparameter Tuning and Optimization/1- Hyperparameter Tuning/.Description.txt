Hyperparameter Tuning is the process of selecting the best set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model. Hyperparameters are the parameters that are not learned from the data but set before the training process begins, such as learning rate, number of layers in a neural network, or the number of trees in a random forest. Tuning involves testing different combinations of these hyperparameters to find the combination that yields the best performance on a validation set.
