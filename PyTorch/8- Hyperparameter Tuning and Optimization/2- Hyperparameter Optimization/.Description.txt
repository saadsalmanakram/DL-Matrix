Hyperparameter Optimization refers to the systematic process of finding the optimal hyperparameters that minimize a predefined loss function on given data. Optimization techniques, such as grid search, random search, or more advanced methods like Bayesian optimization, are used to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and identify the settings that produce the best results.
