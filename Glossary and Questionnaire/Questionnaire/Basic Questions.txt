1- What is Reinforcement Learning?

Ans- Reinforcement Learning is a framework where an agent learns to solve tasks by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards as feedback for its actions.

2- How does an agent learn in Reinforcement Learning?

Ans- An agent learns through trial and error by taking actions in an environment and receiving rewards, either positive or negative, based on the outcomes.

3- Can you provide a real-world analogy for Reinforcement Learning?

Ans- It’s like a child learning to play a video game: by trial and error, they figure out which actions lead to success and which to failure, improving over time.

4- What does the environment represent in Reinforcement Learning?

Ans- The environment is the external system with which the agent interacts, providing feedback based on the agent’s actions.

5- What is the role of rewards in Reinforcement Learning?

Ans- Rewards guide the agent by indicating which actions are beneficial (+1) and which are detrimental (-1) to achieving the task.

6- How is learning achieved without supervision in Reinforcement Learning?

Ans- Learning is achieved through self-discovery, where the agent independently explores actions and their outcomes without any external guidance.
