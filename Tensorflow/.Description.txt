TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google Brain. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem for building, training, and deploying machine learning models at scale. TensorFlow uses a static computation graph, which can be optimized for performance across various hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. It supports a wide range of machine learning algorithms and is used in research and production for applications like image recognition, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. TensorFlow's ecosystem includes tools for model deployment, data processing, and visualization, making it a versatile and powerful choice for AI development.
