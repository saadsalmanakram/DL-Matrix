TensorFlow Lite allows deploying models on mobile and embedded devices. Model optimization techniques help in reducing the model size and improving its performance on limited-resource devices.

Techniques:

Quantization: Reduces the model size and increases performance.
Pruning: Removes redundant weights to reduce model size.
Weight Clustering: Groups weights to reduce the number of unique weights.
