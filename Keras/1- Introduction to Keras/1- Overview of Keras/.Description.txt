Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of other deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow. It provides an easy-to-use interface to build, train, and evaluate deep learning models.

Keras integrates seamlessly with TensorFlow, making it a popular choice for rapid prototyping. Basic operations in Keras involve defining a model, compiling it, training, and evaluating.
