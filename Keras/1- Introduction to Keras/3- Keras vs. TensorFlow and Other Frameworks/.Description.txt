To understand the differences between Keras and other deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Theano.

Keras is built on top of TensorFlow, providing a more user-friendly API for model creation. In contrast, TensorFlow offers more control and flexibility for low-level operations. Here's a brief comparison:

1- Keras: Easier to use, great for beginners and rapid prototyping.
2- TensorFlow: More complex, suitable for detailed model customization and production environments.
3- PyTorch: Known for dynamic computation graphs and easier debugging.
4- Theano: Older framework, less commonly used now.

Keras is often used with TensorFlow, but you can also use it with other backends. The primary difference is in the level of control and ease of use.
