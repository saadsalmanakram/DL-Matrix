Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python, that can run on top of other deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and Theano. Keras is designed to be user-friendly, modular, and extensible, enabling rapid prototyping and experimentation. It abstracts the complexities of the underlying frameworks, allowing users to quickly build and train deep learning models with minimal code. Keras supports both convolutional and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two, and is widely used for its simplicity and ease of integration with other tools and libraries.
